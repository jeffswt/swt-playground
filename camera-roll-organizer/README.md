# iOS Image Renamer

Rename images & videos exported from camera rolls (into your Linux PC) into something that contains the 'Date Taken' field and is sortable by name. The files may then be manually arranged into subdirectories by the corresponding event.

Currently images generated by these cameras are supported (others may work too):

  - iOS &leq; 15.x

There are a number of naming schemes, and the renamer basically converts filenames from one scheme to another:

  - [original]: `{original}`, e.g. `IMG_1357.JPG`
  - [sortable]: `{seq} {yyyy}-{mm}-{dd} [{original}].{ext}`, e.g. `1357 2023-10-24 [IMG_1357.JPG].jpg`

## Usage

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# preview the changes and ensure the script works before committing changes
python3 crorg.py --directory [root_of_conversion] --run-format
# commit changes
python3 crorg.py --directory [root_of_conversion] --run-format --commit
# you may change the results back to what they were at any time
python3 crorg.py --directory [root_of_conversion] --revert-filename
python3 crorg.py --directory [root_of_conversion] --revert-filename --commit
```

## Trivia

We don't currently support this script on Windows bare-metal due to the trouble required to get `libheic` working. Please use WSL instead.
