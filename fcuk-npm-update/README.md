# Fcuk npm update

It never does what I want it to do. Especially when dependencies are broken.

This script forces update on all packages, and write the current version to `package.json`.

**Warning:** backup your files or submit them to the version control before forcing this update!

## Usage

```bash
cd your-project/
python fcuk-npm-update.py  # at somewhere
```
